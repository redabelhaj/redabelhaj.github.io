## Internship work

### Multi-radar tracking optimization for collaborative combat
June - August 2020
A joint work with Nouredine Nour, Cédric L.R. Buron, Alain Peres and Frédéric Barbaresco made during my internship at [NukkAI](http://nukk.ai). I was the main contributor on the reinforcement learning part. To be published at the [CAID](https://en.european-cyber-week.eu/caid) conference. [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11733)

## Academic projects at Ecole polytechnique

### Taking mobility into account in epidemiological models
January 2021 - March 2021

My next project (under the supervision of Pr. Stéphane Gaubert) will aim to study and develop epidemiological models, based on discrete-time SEIR models or on transport PDE models, taking into account the mobility dimension. We will seek to develop dynamic models valid in transitional regimes (pre-lockdown or post-lockdown). The goal is to "explain" the spatial philogenesis of the epidemic. 

### Retweet prediction on Covid-19 tweets
November 2020

Machine Learning 1 - Course [page](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/view.php?id=9331) project.
The goal was to find a ML algorithm to predict the number of retweets of a Covid-19 related tweet.
Report and code will be soon available on my GitHub page.

### Reinforcement learning for the game of Snake
October 2020 - December 2020

Research initiation project (3 hours a week), under the supervision of Guillaume Quispe.
The goal is to design a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for the game of Snake. 
Code + project report are available [Here](https://github.com/redabelhaj/RLSnake)

### EfficientNet for object detection
June 2020  
A computer vision project made with Mohamed Amine Rabhi based on Tan & Le's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946). Link to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/redabelhaj/efficientnet)

### Prediction of probability of default (with BNP Paribas)
March 2020  
A deep learning project proposed by BNP Paribas RISK (under the supervision of Michael Rabba) and made with Céline Raton, Amine Rabhi, Pierre Mordant and Michel Alhawa. [Download](https://github.com/redabelhaj/redabelhaj.github.io/raw/master/Rapport_PSC_Anglais%20(1).pdf) the project report (PDF).  

### User Scheduling in 5G
January 2020  
A combinatory optimization project made with Amine Rabhi, under the supervision of Marceau Coupechoux. Link to the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/AmineRabhi/User-Scheduling-in-5G). 

## Academic projects at Lycée Sainte-Geneviève (TIPE : "supervised self-initiative work")

### Lorenz equations and highlighting of a strange attractor
2018
A mathematics project which was presented at the exams for french "Grandes Écoles", done in collaboration with Nils Hasselmark and Anas El Baghdadi, under the supervision of Pr. Aymeric Autin. The goal was to study some of the properties of the famous [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). Here are the [slides](https://github.com/redabelhaj/redabelhaj.github.io/raw/master/slides_TIPE.pdf) - in French - of my final presentation.


### Sharkovskii's theorem
2017
A mathematics project aiming to give a elementary proof of the [Sharkovskii's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharkovskii%27s_theorem), done in collaboration with Anas El Baghdadi and Mathieu Gomez, under the supervision of Pr. Frédéric Morlot. Here is the final [report](https://github.com/redabelhaj/redabelhaj.github.io/raw/master/rapport-tipe-sup.pdf) - in French.
