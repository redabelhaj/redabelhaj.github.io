## Internship work

### Multi-radar tracking optimization for collaborative combat
June - August 2020
A joint work with Nouredine Nour, Cédric L.R. Buron, Alain Peres and Frédéric Barbaresco made during my internship at [NukkAI](http://nukk.ai). I was the main contributor on the reinforcement learning part. To be published at the [CAID](https://en.european-cyber-week.eu/caid) conference. Paper will be available soon.

### Lorenz equations and highlighting of a strange attractor
2018
A mathematics project which was presented at the exams for french "Grandes Écoles", done in collaboration with Nils Hasselmark and Anas El Baghdadi. The goal was to study some of the properties of the famous [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). Here are the [slides](https://github.com/redabelhaj/redabelhaj.github.io/raw/master/slides_TIPE.pdf) - in French - of my final presentation.


### Sharkovskii's theorem
2017
A mathematics project aiming to give a elementary proof of the [Sharkovskii's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharkovskii%27s_theorem), done in collaboration with Anas El Baghdadi and Mathieu Gomez. Here is the final [report](https://github.com/redabelhaj/redabelhaj.github.io/raw/master/rapport-tipe-sup.pdf) - in French.
